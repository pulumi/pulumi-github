/**
 * Use this data source to find out if a user is a member of your organization, as well
 * as what role they have within it.
 * If the user's membership in the organization is pending their acceptance of an invite,
 * the role they would have once they accept will be returned.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as github from "@pulumi/github";
 *
 * const membershipForSomeUser = pulumi.output(github.getMembership({
 *     username: "SomeUser",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
