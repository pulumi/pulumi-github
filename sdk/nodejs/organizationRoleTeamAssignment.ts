/**
 * > **Note:** This resource is deprecated, please use the `github.OrganizationRoleTeam` resource instead.
 *
 * This resource manages relationships between teams and organization roles
 * in your GitHub organization. This works on predefined roles, and custom roles, where the latter is an Enterprise feature.
 *
 * Creating this resource assigns the role to a team.
 *
 * The organization role and team must both belong to the same organization
 * on GitHub.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as github from "@pulumi/github";
 *
 * const test_team = new github.Team("test-team", {name: "test-team"});
 * const test_team_role_assignment = new github.OrganizationRoleTeamAssignment("test-team-role-assignment", {
 *     teamSlug: test_team.slug,
 *     roleId: "8132",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GitHub Team Organization Role Assignment can be imported using an ID made up of `team_slug:role_id`
 *
 * text
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import github:index/organizationRoleTeamAssignment:OrganizationRoleTeamAssignment role_assignment test-team:8132
 * ```
