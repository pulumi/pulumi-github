/**
 * Provides a GitHub team membership resource.
 *
 * This resource allows you to add/remove users from teams in your organization. When applied,
 * the user will be added to the team. If the user hasn't accepted their invitation to the
 * organization, they won't be part of the team until they do. When
 * destroyed, the user will be removed from the team.
 *
 * > **Note** This resource is not compatible with `github.TeamMembers`. Use either `github.TeamMembers` or `github.TeamMembership`.
 *
 * > **Note** Organization owners may not be set as "members" of a team; they may only be set as "maintainers". Attempting to set organization an owner to "member" of a may result in a `pulumi preview` diff that changes their status back to "maintainer".
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as github from "@pulumi/github";
 *
 * // Add a user to the organization
 * const membershipForSomeUser = new github.Membership("membershipForSomeUser", {
 *     username: "SomeUser",
 *     role: "member",
 * });
 * const someTeam = new github.Team("someTeam", {description: "Some cool team"});
 * const someTeamMembership = new github.TeamMembership("someTeamMembership", {
 *     teamId: someTeam.id,
 *     username: "SomeUser",
 *     role: "member",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GitHub Team Membership can be imported using an ID made up of `teamid:username` or `teamname:username`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import github:index/teamMembership:TeamMembership member 1234567:someuser
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import github:index/teamMembership:TeamMembership member Administrators:someuser
 * ```
