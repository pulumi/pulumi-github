/**
 * Provides a GitHub team membership resource.
 * 
 * This resource allows you to add/remove users from teams in your organization. When applied,
 * the user will be added to the team. If the user hasn't accepted their invitation to the
 * organization, they won't be part of the team until they do. When
 * destroyed, the user will be removed from the team.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as github from "@pulumi/github";
 * 
 * // Add a user to the organization
 * const membershipForSomeUser = new github.Membership("membershipForSomeUser", {
 *     role: "member",
 *     username: "SomeUser",
 * });
 * const someTeam = new github.Team("someTeam", {
 *     description: "Some cool team",
 * });
 * const someTeamMembership = new github.TeamMembership("someTeamMembership", {
 *     role: "member",
 *     teamId: someTeam.id,
 *     username: "SomeUser",
 * });
 * ```
