/**
 * Use this data source to retrieve information about a GitHub release in a specific repository.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * To retrieve the latest release that is present in a repository:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as github from "@pulumi/github";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(github.getRelease({
 *     owner: "example-owner",
 *     repository: "example-repository",
 *     retrieveBy: "latest",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 *
 * To retrieve a specific release from a repository based on it's ID:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as github from "@pulumi/github";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(github.getRelease({
 *     id: "12345",
 *     owner: "example-owner",
 *     repository: "example-repository",
 *     retrieveBy: "id",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, to retrieve a release based on it's tag:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as github from "@pulumi/github";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(github.getRelease({
 *     owner: "example-owner",
 *     releaseTag: "v1.0.0",
 *     repository: "example-repository",
 *     retrieveBy: "tag",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
