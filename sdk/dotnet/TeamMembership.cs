    /// <summary>
    /// Provides a GitHub team membership resource.
    /// 
    /// This resource allows you to add/remove users from teams in your organization. When applied,
    /// the user will be added to the team. If the user hasn't accepted their invitation to the
    /// organization, they won't be part of the team until they do. When
    /// destroyed, the user will be removed from the team.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** This resource is not compatible with `github.TeamMembers`. Use either `github.TeamMembers` or `github.TeamMembership`.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** Organization owners may not be set as "members" of a team; they may only be set as "maintainers". Attempting to set an organization owner as a "member" of a team may result in a `pulumi preview` diff that changes their status back to "maintainer".
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Github = Pulumi.Github;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     // Add a user to the organization
    ///     var membershipForSomeUser = new Github.Membership("membership_for_some_user", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Username = "SomeUser",
    ///         Role = "member",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var someTeam = new Github.Team("some_team", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "SomeTeam",
    ///         Description = "Some cool team",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var someTeamMembership = new Github.TeamMembership("some_team_membership", new()
    ///     {
    ///         TeamId = someTeam.Id,
    ///         Username = "SomeUser",
    ///         Role = "member",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// GitHub Team Membership can be imported using an ID made up of `teamid:username` or `teamname:username`, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import github:index/teamMembership:TeamMembership member 1234567:someuser
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import github:index/teamMembership:TeamMembership member Administrators:someuser
    /// ```
